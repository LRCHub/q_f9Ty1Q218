The people I've met on my way
On this journey through life every day
Some have become friends and will stay
They'll always be right there, come what may

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo, ah

Some are poor and some very chic
But each person in himself is unique
On each one I know I can depend
To make this life interesting 'til the end

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way

Some will come to my defense
When trouble's ready to commence
Others come and go like trends
But oh, I wouldn't trade those friends

I met on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way

Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo, ah
Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo
Too doo doo doo, ah
